# COVID-19 Provincial Tracking, Data Reconciliation & Reporting System


## üìÑ Project Summary

This project involved the end-to-end design, development, and implementation of a province-wide database to track over 50,000 COVID-19 records. The system automated daily reporting and provided real-time dashboards for senior leadership, drastically improving decision-making capabilities during the pandemic.

## üéØ The Problem

The Department of Health needed a centralized and efficient way to track a high volume of COVID-19 case data from over 20 municipalities. Manual reporting was slow, error-prone, and could not provide the timely insights required by leadership to manage the public health response.

## üí° The Solution

I led the development of a robust tracking system using systems analysis and design methodology. The solution involved:
* **Workflow Design:** Mapping the entire data flow from municipal health offices to a central database.
* **Data Modeling:** Structuring the database to handle complex case and vaccination information.
* **Automation:** Using Excel and Power Query to automate the consolidation and reporting of data, which fed into a real-time dashboard.

## ‚ú® Key Achievements & Impact

* **Reduced Reporting Time:** Automated daily and weekly reports, cutting the turnaround time from 6 hours to just 1 hour.
* **Improved Data Accuracy:** Led virtual training for over 120 health workers on the new tools, which raised data accuracy by 20%.
* **Enhanced Data Collection:** Collaborated with the IT department to integrate web-based survey forms, improving the data response rate by 35%.
* **Enabled Leadership Decisions:** The system provided real-time dashboards that were critical for decision-making by senior health officials.

## üõ†Ô∏è My Role & Responsibilities

As the Health Program Officer, I served as the **Project Lead**. My responsibilities included:
* Gathering requirements from stakeholders.
* Conducting systems analysis and designing the data workflow.
